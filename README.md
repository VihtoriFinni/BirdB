## 🎨 Customization

### Asset Placement

Place your pixel art images in the `assets/` folder:

**Scene Assets** (`assets/scene/`):
- `window-table.png` - Combined window + table foreground (900×400px recommended)
- `sky-gradient.png` - Sky background
- `clouds.png` - Cloud sprite for animation
- `trees.png` - Trees/landscape background

**Item Assets** (`assets/items/`):
- `coffee-maker.png` - Coffee maker sprite (~100×100px recommended)
- `binoculars.png` - Binoculars sprite (~60×60px recommended)
- `notebook.png` - Notebook sprite (~250×180px recommended)

**UI Assets** (`assets/ui/`):
- `map.png` - World map image (full size, mini version is auto-cropped)

### Positioning & Scaling

All item positions can be easily adjusted in `style.css`. Look for the commented sections:

```css
/* ========== ITEMS POSITIONING & SCALING ========== */
/* Coffee Maker */
.coffee-maker {
    left: 58%;         /* Move left/right */
    bottom: 70%;       /* Move up/down */
    max-width: 80px;   /* Size */
}

/* Similar controls for notebook, binoculars, map, clouds, etc. */
```

### Background Adjustments

```css
/* ========== BACKGROUND POSITION ADJUSTMENTS ========== */
.scene-background {
    top: 2%;          /* Window area position from top */
    left: 4%;         /* Window area position from left */
    width: 95%;       /* Window area width */
    height: 58%;      /* Window area height */
}

.sky-bg {
    transform: translateX(0%);  /* Move sky horizontally */
}

.trees-bg {
    transform: translateX(-8%); /* Move trees horizontally */
}
```
